# Arduino Based Voice Controlled Robot Vehicle

## Introduction

This project features a voice-controlled robot vehicle powered by an Arduino microcontroller and Bluetooth technology. The robot can be controlled through voice commands or buttons in an Android application. The system utilizes Bluetooth communication to relay commands from the app to the robot, which then drives DC servo motors based on the received commands.

- **Arduino UNO**: Microcontroller board that processes commands and controls the robot's movements.
- **L298D Motor Driver**: IC that drives the DC motors based on the signals from the Arduino.
- **HC-05 Bluetooth Module**: Module for wireless communication between the Android app and the Arduino.

## How It Works

1. **Voice Command Recognition:**
   - The Android smartphone's microphone captures the user's voice commands.
   - The voice is converted to text using Androidâ€™s speech recognition software.

3. **Microcontroller Processing:**
   - The Arduino UNO receives and decodes the commands from the HC-05 module.
   - The decoded commands are used to control the DC motors through the L298D Motor Driver.
